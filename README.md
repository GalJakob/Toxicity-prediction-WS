# Toxicity prediction🧪

The project is built upon improved libraries of pre-trained machine learning models from various fields.

## Requirements
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [rdkit](https://www.rdkit.org/)

It is highly recommended to use a GPU.

any other requirements for specific models is written and explained in the coding files.

## Getting Started
To get started you need to choose the model you want to engage and open the colab notebook in the coding folder where the targeted file is placed.

from a general prespective, all coding files have the same chunk of code of importing the datasets which are placed in this repository project for your convenient use.

the datasets are splitted into 3 categories:
- original datasets
- train datasets
- test datasets

the train and test datasets are splitted 80/20 corrrespondingly. furthermore, in the train dataset folder their are files which was augmented (the operation of adding artifical data by a generator by code) and named after that. This was a part of balancing the data and essential part of the project.
